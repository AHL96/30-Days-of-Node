# 30 Days of node

As an attempt to start learning node.js I'm going to do a 30 consecutive day node challenge.

I will be following along with this website [30 days of node](http://https://www.nodejsera.com/30-days-of-node.html)

I most likely wont stick to their regiment. I will move at my own pass but do no less than what they have set for one day. (or try my best :) )
